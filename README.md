# Custom Text Editor
This is a Custom Text Editor I want to make for my own use. I will refer to it at CTE for short. CTE is also an acronym for [chonic traumatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy), a brain disease linked to head trauma commonly found in athletes of combat or contact sports. I greatly enjoy those sports, so I make references to the disease in the code, although I do try to keep that to a minimum because it is not necessarily the best practice. 

As of right now, this is just a side project I am doing both for fun and for practice. I have other responsibilities and I invest a lot of time directly into school so I have not had as much time as I would like to have on this project, but I try to chip in while I can. I work the most on this over break, but those usually last 1 to 2 weeks. Because of this I try to document as much as I can within the issues.

# Goals (Program and Project)
* Create a usuable software that allows me to more effectively write essays
* Demonstrate/practice the skills I have learned throughout school
* Strive for "best practice" to hone my profesionalism
* Learn new concepts as I go, especially creating applications.
