# Custom Text Editor
This is a Custom Text Editor I want to make for my own use. I will refer to it at CTE for short. CTE is also an acronym for [chonic traumatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy), a brain disease linked to head trauma commonly found in athletes of combat or contact sports. I greatly enjoy those sports, so I make references to the disease in the code, although I do try to keep that to a minimum because it is not necessarily the best practice. 

# Goals (Program and Project)
* Create a usuable software that allows me to more effectively write essays
* Demonstrate/practice the skills I have learned throughout school
* Strive for "best practice" to hone my profesionalism
* Learn new concepts as I go, especially creating applications.
